# Week 3

## Bastien
First I finished adding the possibility to add images from the gallery in the new item and edit item.
Then I started working on adding the possibility to do so with the camera but didn't manage to finish it.

The feature is not finished because I needed to refactor the code, but I can't find a way to make it work while being separated despite receiving help from Lucas.

My time estimate was a bit off for the first task, and a lot off for the second one.

This week, we implemented the login via Google. A user can now use their Google account to log in. They press the "Account" button on the main screen and will get directed to their "account" page where they can use the Login button (that has a Google logo) in order to log in. They will get prompted to an interface made by Google, during which they will be able to select which account they want to log in on (or link a new already existing account). They also have the option to create a new account (in which case they will be guided through some setup steps that are also inside the Google-made interface).

## Sebastian
I added a location to items, with the possibility to fetch the current location of the device through a button. 

With the research and trials-failures, this feature took me around 5 hours. However, I had to spent at least three hours refactoring the code as some new parts were very similar with what already was implemented for the map feature. 

I started the feature where the items are displayed on the map.

Overall, my time estimates were not accurate.

## Overall team
We did two stand-up meetings this week: on Monday and Thursday. 

The first one was not really useful as most of the members hadn't worked on the project yet.

Some members had problems with Cirrus CI and codeclimate, but we managed to make it work in the end. Everyone participated in at least a review, and all members implemented at least a feature.

Almost all the work that was supposed to be done this week was finished, but not all all since we lost a lot of time because of the CI constantly failing for no apparent reason.
