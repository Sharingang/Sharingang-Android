# Week 9

## Bastien
This week I started by finishing my last draft PR to subscribe to different categories.
Then I created a view where the user can see their subscriptions.
Then I added logic to be able to receive push notifications when a new item is created and the user is subscribed to the category of the item. This was done using Firebase Cloud Messaging and Firebase Functions for the automation.
My time estimates were pretty much on point for this week's tasks.


## Ben
This week I added the chat to the app.
Now the users are able to chat in order to communicate about 
items or meeting points.
I think my time estimates were a bit off, as I underestimated 
how much time it would take me.
Overall everything was quite challenging (making adapters, 
creating drawables, manipulating the database) in its own 
way, but I feel like I learned a lot this week.


## Lúcás
This week I spent some time researching how to do the AR task, and settled on first gathering all of the
sensor data necessary this week, and doing the visualization next week.

It took me more effort than required to gather the sensor data, because I had to wrangle and modify
the existing permission infrastructure. Ultimately, I didn't manage to finish everything I wanted to do.

I'm still not all that good at estimating things that require using new APIs.


## Sebastian
This week, I implemented a way to make items either offers or requests: I thought this feature might be useful in case the users wanted to trade items instead of buying/selling. 

My time estimates were accurate.


## Samuel
This week I added the ability to pay for items in the app. For the payment provider, I used Stripe. As for the other external services, I also implemented a fake payment provider to be used in the tests.

When estimating the time for the task, I split the story in multiple subtasks and estimated each task. As a result I was more accurate with the estimation.


## Zacharie
This week I worked on documenting the code for the entire project. This took roughly as much time as I had anticipated.
No real problems encountered, just a few difference of opinions with peoples' way of documenting.
Next week I will start working on new features again now that the documentation is done.


## Overall team
We did 2 stand-up meetings, the first one on Tuesday and the second on Thursday. On Tuesday, we discussed about some difficulties each one of us had and what we have been working on so far. On Thursday, we had a few PRs open so we assigned reviewers and chose the order in which it will be merged to avoid blocking others. Everyone was working on a different part of the app so it was easy to merge.
