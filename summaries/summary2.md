# Week 2

## Ben
A feature that has been added this week is putting the price into the New and Edit item view. Therefore, when a user wants to create a new item or edit an already existing one, they can now also set the price and edit it, not only the title and the description. When the field for the price is left blank, a default price of 0.0 is set for that particular item.

Overall this task was not too difficult and did not take a huge amount of time, however, issues have occurred with Cirrus which did not help us merge the pull request as fast as planned.

Last week we didn't have time to perfect the integration of the database and the other features (add and edit items, navigation).
So I've checked with Bastien who did the item edit and fragment navigation to improve the integration.

Then I added new classes to store and retrieve users and did some refactoring.
It will be useful when we'll do the user authentication next week with Ben.

I also continued a bit with the Android Kotlin codelabs and helps my teammates who were using the database.

My time estimate was more accurate this time.

## Overall team
We only had one stand-up meeting at the beginning of the week but we stayed in contact on the WhatsApp group.

The pull requests where spread throughout the week so it was easier to integrate them and we were not blocking each others.
Also everyone contributed for the code reviews and had at least a feature merged.

We still had some issues with Cirrus CI who went down on Monday and made us lose some time.
But the rest of the week we had less issues with it. 

A large part of features were implemented but we still have a few left for next week (authentication, search and cache).
