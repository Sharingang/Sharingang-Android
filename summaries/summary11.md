# Week 11

## Bastien
My first task this week was to work on the UI to have an indicator when an item was discounted.

I then added a discount filter to the search fragment. My estimate was off for this task, it took way less time than expecting thanks to how the search was already done before.

Finally I spent most of my time to fix the bug where we couldn't edit images anymore. This took me around 5 hours, as estimated.

## Ben
This week, I added two things. First, I added the message timestamps, so that users know when they have sent/received a particular message. Second, I added an indicator on the item which tells the user when a last item was updated (seconds, minutes, etc) to inform the potential buyer about some potentially outdated items (if the offer has been posted too long ago).
I didn't have much trouble this week, except from the fact that I had to create a DateHelper, which makes some date calculations for us, and I also needed to access string resources from that class, which was a pain in the neck as I needed to provide a Context (hence changing many things here and there). My times estimates were accurate. I really didn't enjoy working on these features however.

## Lúcás
Initially, I wanted to integrate our sensor collection into an AR feature. I ran into some major problems, because I couldn't get even basic demos to work on either the emulator, or my own phone, so I decided to scrap this idea and move on to a different feature.

Instead, I worked on adding a way to request weather information at the location of an item. I wasn't really blocked on this, although I ran into an issue where the coverage report for my code was obviously wrong, and didn't manage to find a way to fix that.

My estimates were really bad this week, mainly because of these unforeseen blockers.

## Sebastian
This week I added the notification feature for the chat (receive a notification every time someone else sends a message). It took me more time than I expected because I needed time to understand how it all worked.

## Samuel
Samuel was absent this week because he had the "protection civile".

## Zacharie
This week I implemented a purchase history so sellers could find the objects they have bought in the past.
Time estimations were accurate and I worked fairly efficiently for once.
I don't yet know what I will be doing next week but most likely work on bug fixing.

## Overall team
As usual, we did two stand-up meetings: one on Tuesday and the second on Thursday. 
The work was done relatively early during the week, so we didn't have many PRs to review and merge one thursday night.
Overall the team did a great job and everything went smoothly.
