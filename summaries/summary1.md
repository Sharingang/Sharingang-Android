# Week 1

I followed the [android kotlin codelabs](https://developer.android.com/courses/kotlin-android-fundamentals/overview) to to understand how to have a good architecture.
I then converted the existing Activities in Fragments and added navigation while keeping the same functionality.
Finally, by following the codelab concerning RecyclerViews, I added a button next to an item to be able to edit it.
I did not have enough time to start on researching how to add images in the application from the phone nor to implement it.

My time estimate was way off because I had to look up a lot of resources to understand the existing code and try to implement my functionalites nicely.

Next time, I'll know where some specific resources are so that I won't spend as much time looking for it.
